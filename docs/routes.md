- **Slug** A dynamic URL path segment.

## App directory

The root level `app/` directory is used to define all routes and screens in the app. This could be customizable in the future, but that's not a priority as of now.

<details>
  <summary>Interoperability</summary>

- The `app/` directory is similar to the:
- `app/routes/` directory in [Remix](https://remix.run/docs/en/v1/guides/routing#defining-routes).
- `pages/` directory in [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/pages).
- `src/routes/` directory in [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/routing).
- `app/` directory in the [Next.js layouts RFC](https://nextjs.org/blog/layouts-rfc#introducing-the-app-directory).

The entry file for classic Expo apps is `App.js`, the Expo config file is `app.json` (or `app.config.js`), and the Expo conference is called **App.js conf** so to keep things relatively consistent, the root directory is called `app/`. Luckily, most web frameworks are also using `app/` so it aligns well. This does mean you'll need a monorepo if you want to use Expo and another framework in the same repo.

# Routes

Routes are defined as files in the `app/` directory. The file name is the route path, and the file exports a React component that renders the page.

```sh
app/
  index.js
```

```tsx
// index.js
import { Text } from "react-native";

export default function Page() {
  return <Text>First page</Text>;
}
```

This renders to:

```xml
<App>
  <Index />
</App>
```

- Any path in the `app/` directory can be used as a root path. There is no global root path.
- You can use extensions: `js`, `tsx`, `ts`, `tsx`. In a future iteration we will add support for any extension in the Metro config [`resolver.sourceExts`](https://facebook.github.io/metro/docs/configuration#sourceexts).
- Platform extensions like `.ios.js` or `.native.ts` are not currently supported in the `app/` directory.

<details>
  <summary>Interoperability</summary>

The routes convention is:

- Most closely related to the routes system in Remix.
- Similar to the [pages API](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/pages) in Next.js but with the added nested functionality, effectively Remix.
- The routes convention is the largest departure from the Next.js Layouts RFC.

</details>

## Layout Routes

To render shared navigation elements like a header, tab bar, or drawer, you can use a layout route.
If a directory has a sibling file with the same name, it will be used as the parent for the files in the directory.

```sh
app/
  (stack).js # Layout route. This is where a header bar would go
  (stack)/ # Children of (stack).js
    home.js # A child route of (stack).js
```

If you create a child route without a matching parent route, then a virtual, unstyled navigator will be generated in-memory to accommodate the child route:

```sh
app/
  (stack)/ # Unpaired layout route
    home.js # Child route of a virtual navigator
  (stack).tsx # This file exists in-memory to render the `(stack)/home.js` route. Creating this file will override the in-memory route
```

The virtual route system exists to accommodate native navigation which requires a parent navigator to render a child route. Web apps traditionally don't need this due to web hosting.

<details>
  <summary>Interoperability</summary>

Nested routes are used to implement nested navigation in [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/nesting-navigators).

This convention is analogous to [nested routing](https://remix.run/docs/en/v1/guides/routing#what-is-nested-routing) (same format) in Remix, `pages/_app.js` in Next.js, and [Layouts](https://nextjs.org/blog/layouts-rfc#layouts) (`folder/layout.js`) in the Next.js layouts RFC.

</details>

## Child Routes

A child route refers to a route that has no nested children, it shows up at the end of a URL.

## Fragment Routes

Fragment routes add nested layout without appending any path segments. Think of them like `index.js` but as a layout. These are most commonly used for adding navigators like tab, stack, drawer, etc... The format is `(name).js` and `/(name)`, the `name` is purely cosmetic.

```sh
app/
  layout.js # Layout route
  layout/
    home.js # ùù†.com/layout/home

app/
  (layout).js # Fragment route
  (layout)/
    home.js # ùù†.com/home
```

Both of these will render:

```
<App>
  <Layout>
    <Home />
  </Layout>
</App>
```

Be careful when using parallel fragment routes as they can create conflicting routes that match the same path. For example, the following routes will conflict:

```sh
app/
  profile.js # Matches /profile
  (layout).js
  (layout)/
    profile.js # Matches /profile (conflict)
```

Expo router will assert when there are route collisions.

The name 'Fragment' route is a nod to [React Fragments](https://reactjs.org/docs/fragments.html) (`<>{...}</>`) which wrap components without adding any additional views to the hierarchy.

<details>
  <summary>Previous iteration</summary>

We originally considered using `index/` instead of `(index)/` since the leaf variation is automatically collapsed. This was rejected because `/index/index` was not a valid path for fragments but it was for leaf routes. Theoretically we should also be able to support multiple fragments in a single directory for swapping parent layouts.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Interoperability</summary>

The Fragment convention is similar to:

- Groups in [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/advanced-routing#advanced-layouts-group) (`(group)`).
- [pathless layout routes](https://remix.run/docs/en/v1/guides/routing#pathless-layout-routes) in Remix (`__group`)
- [Route Groups](https://nextjs.org/blog/layouts-rfc#route-groups) in the upcoming Next.js layouts RFC (`(group)`).

The format is the same as SvelteKit/upcoming Next.js but the implementation and usage is a bit different.

</details>

## Index Routes

- If a route is named `./index.js`, it will add both `index` and `/` to the route, effectively acting as a [fragment route](#fragment-routes).
- Directories cannot be named `/index/`. The filename `/index.js` is reserved for [leaf routes](#leaf-routes).
- An index route cannot be at the same level as a [fragment route](#fragment-routes) as they'd both match `/`.

Index routes are based on the original `index.html` system from the Tim Berners-Lee/Apache HTTP Server days. The idea is that if you visit a directory, you'll see a list of all the available files by default making it easy to navigate the site in development. Users could then override the default behavior by creating an `index.html` file to provide a better navigation experience.

To that end, if you visit a directory in Expo, you'll see a list of all the available files. If you visit a directory in Expo that has an `index.js` or nested parent route, you'll see the rendered page instead.

## Dynamic Routes

Dynamic routes are routes that have a variable part. For example, `/blog/post/[id]` is a dynamic route. The variable part (`[id]`) is called a "slug". The slug is the part of the URL that is dynamic. The slug is defined by the file name. For example, `/blog/post/bacon` is defined by the file `/blog/post/[id].tsx`.

- `[id].js` will match `/blog/1` and `/blog/2` and provide the query `{ id: 1 }` and `{ id: 2 }` respectively.

Routes with higher specificity will be matched first. For example, `/blog/bacon` will match `blog/bacon.js` before `blog/[id].js`.

> By [popular demand](https://twitter.com/Baconbrix/status/1567538444246589441), the dynamic routes pattern is based on the [Next.js dynamic routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/routing/dynamic-routes) system.

There are a couple different ways to implement dynamic routes, here are some existing formats:

| Format              | Framework |
| ------------------- | --------- |
| `/blog/[id].js`     | Next.js   |
| `/blog/[id].svelte` | SvelteKit |
| `/blog/$id.js`      | Remix     |

</details>

## Deep Dynamic Routes

Similar to dynamic routes, but the slug matches any number of path components in a route. For example, `/blog/post/[...id]` is a deep dynamic route. The variable part (`[...id]`) is called a "slug". The slug is the part of the URL that is dynamic. The slug is defined by the file name. For example, `/blog/post/bacon/cheese` is defined by the file `/blog/post/[...id].tsx`.

`[...ids].js` will match `/blog/1/2/3` and provide the query `{ ids: [1, 2, 3] }`.

<details>
  <summary>Interoperability</summary>

This convention is functionally analogous to the 'optional catch-all dynamic routes' (`[[...id]].js`) feature from Next.js but the syntax is different. Unlike Next.js which has a separate syntax for matching everything except index, Expo uses the same syntax for both. If you want to match everything except index, you can add an `index.js` file that has custom handling or you could intercept the path and treat it differently. We also reserve the term **catch** for error handling.

The convention is also similar to splats in Remix.
