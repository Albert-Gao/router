Users have been building powerful apps with Expo for years now. We've learned a lot about what works and what doesn't work for developers. We've also learned a lot about what works and what doesn't work for users. Over the last few years we've focused on solving many of the foundational issues with native development like code signing, building, upgrading, and publishing.

Now that we have this solid foundation and developer experience, we want to provide developers with an opinionated framework that enables a drastically better experience for end users.

We've been working on a new router that generates nested navigation and deep links based entirely on the project's file system. The concept of a file system-based router is not new to web developers (PHP, Next.js, etc.), but it is **brand new** to mobile developers. By bringing this foundational paradigm to mobile, we can solve many of the problems that developers encounter when building complex apps.

The first problems we want to solve are:

**Creating apps with nested native navigation that are easy to maintain, scale, and refactor.**

Websites are most often based on the concept of pages and links. Each page is a file in the project's file system. Each link is a URL. This is a very simple and powerful concept that has been used for decades. It's also a concept that has been adopted by many modern web frameworks like Next.js, Gatsby, and Nuxt.js.

This paradigm is intuitive and powerful because developers can easily create new pages and links without having to worry about the underlying implementation. The framework handles the routing and navigation for you.

**Making any part of the app instantly shareable via deep links.**

Tooling can also optimize the app in many ways. For example, a framework can generate deep links for each page and link. This enables the app to be opened from a URL or a push notification. It also you to share any part of the app instantly with anyone--a feature that is often reserved for projects with massive teams and budgets.

Imagine if you wanted to share a photo with a friend so you sent them a link to instagram.com and told them to search around until they find the exact page you were talking about. That's how sharing works in most apps today. It's not a great experience.

The web has solved this problem for decades by associating every page with a URL that can be instantly shared and visited by anyone. We plan to bring this same flexibility to mobile apps via Expo router.

Because Expo is multi-platform, you can develop your routes once and share them across iOS, Android, and the web. This means you can utilize the built-in URL handling of the browser to quickly build out your native apps routes.

**Building apps that are fast, reliable, and work offline-first.**

Unlike the web, native apps must always work offline-first. This means that the app must be able to handle any incoming URL without a network connection or server. This is a very difficult problem to solve and requires a lot of tooling and infrastructure to make it work while feeling native.

The hardest part of this process was creating a performant system for making native apps using JavaScript, e.g. React Native with the Expo SDK. Everything else could be implemented using advanced CLI and bundler techniques which we implemented using the bundler built for ridiculous scale: Metro.

The end-user experience is fast and light-weight, and the developer experience is lightning fast utilizing universal Fast Refresh, incremental bundling, and intelligent artifact memoization.

**Handling errors and data fetching states in a consistent way.**

One of the most exciting parts of React is the ability to atomize your app's UI and data fetching into reusable components. Web-only frameworks have been able to take advantage of this for years, but we've yet to see a React Native framework that could provide the same experience.

Expo router has the ability to setup React Error Boundaries for each route (Suspense boundaries coming in a later version). This means that you can easily handle errors and data fetching states in a consistent way across the entire app and retry failed requests.

This is large departure from the traditional approach of handling errors in a native app: throwing a fatal error and crashing the app with no indication of what went wrong. This is a terrible user experience and something we're excited to move away from.

The initial version of Expo router just scratches the surface of data fetching and error handling. We can implement smart component-based React Suspense boundaries, data fetching hooks, font/asset loading, and automated splash screen orchestration in the future.

## Request for Comments

We're excited to share the early beta of Expo router with you today. We want to hear your feedback and help us push the boundaries of what's possible with mobile development!

We're looking for feedback on the following:

- **API Design**: Specifically the routing convention and layouts API. We want to make sure the API is intuitive and easy to use.
- **Tooling and workflow**: We want to make sure the tooling is fast and easy to use. We also want to make sure the workflow is intuitive and easy to understand, this is especially true for navigating URLs on a native device where there is no URL bar.
- **Performance**: We want to make sure the app is fast and reliable. We also want to make sure the app is small and light-weight. We're currently focused on "make it work" with "make it fast" features like code splitting, bundle splitting, and lazy loading coming in a future version. The file system-based router enables us to implement many performance optimizations behind the scenes without the need to refactor in the future.
